Based on the graph showing the "Percent total of Iowa Income by Zip Code", it appears that the
zip codes in central Iowa, particularly near Des Moines, tend to contribute to a larger portion 
of Iowa's total income compared to other areas in the state. Other zip codes near the borders of 
Nebraska and Illinois also have relatively high levels of income, while areas around the borders of 
Minnesota and Missouri are on the lower end of relative income levels. The idea that zip codes 
containing or near cities like Des Moines and Cedar Rapids have higher relative income is not 
surprising in itself, but I think this graph highlights the economic significance of Iowa 
being a state that is surrounded by six other states. Income seems drastically different from 
one zip code to another based on which state borders each zip code, and it suggests that alcohol 
consumption in Iowa may also be influenced by the taxes, regulations, and culture of the many 
States that border Iowa. While it's unlikely that we will be able to interpret just how much each 
bordering State influences alcohol consumption in Iowa relative to income, it's worth acknowledging 
this potential limitation when it comes to making conclusive statements regarding 
whether income and alcohol consumption have a definite causal relationship.
