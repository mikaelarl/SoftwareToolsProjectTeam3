## Research Topic
### The question: 
To what extent does an individual's income affect their consumption of alcohol in Iowa?
### The Decision-Maker and the Decision To-Be-Made
Local policymakers evaluating the efficacy of alcohol excise taxes and determining future levels of these taxes

## The Data 
The current analysis will utilize a data set capturing alcohol sales, as well as various economic and demographic variables, in Iowa from 2012 to 2016. The data set includes economic, demographic, and sales data at the city, county, and zip-code levels. Consequently, our analysis can examine the potential impact of income on liquor sales at these different levels of specificity. Further, the sales portion of the data set specifies different liquor categories. This will be particularly useful for our analysis, as we will be able to examine the potential impacts of income on the purchase of different types of alcohol. This will be useful for the policymaker in determining excise tax levels for different liquor categories. 

## Tools and Methods for the Analysis
The current analysis will use a combination of R and Tableau to examine the impact of income on liquor sales in Iowa from 2012 to 2016. The analysis will examine this relationship at different levels of geographic specificity and across different liquor categories.
