# Software Tools Project - Team 3

## ADEC 7900 Software Tools for Data Analysis Group Project
### Team 3
#### Paul Gaski, Michael Pomer, Mikaela Renaud-Lowther, and Justin Nevins

## Research Topic
### The question: 
To what extent does an individual's income affect their consumption of alcohol in Iowa?
### The Decision-Maker and the Decision To-Be-Made
Local policymakers evaluating the efficacy of alcohol excise taxes and determining future levels of these taxes

## The 8 Major Tasks
1. Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration.
2. Analyze and visualize ACS data using Tableau and/or R.
3. Analyze and visualize aggregated sales data using Tableau and/or R.
4. Merge aggregated liquor sales data with ACS data per each geography (zipcodes, cities, counties). This will result in 3 data sets. If using Tableau, create 3 workbooks.
5. Visualize and identify patterns in liquor sales across geographies and ACS metrics using R and/or Tableau.
6. Submit draft of progress at Checkpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2.
7. Summarize your findings in a short video presentation.
8. Publish a detailed, well-formatted R-markdown report of your analytical story to your GitHub repository (see project instructions for details).

## Checkpoint 1 Progress
Our group has completed tasks 1 and 4. We have been working on tasks 2, 3, and 5 (analyzing and visualizing our data in order to identify relevant trends). We are finding using GitHub as a collaborative platform to be quite helpful for aiding our work as a group. It is also useful in tracking individual changes and progress. 

### Checkpoint 1 Individual Group Member Contributions: 

Mikaela: I have created a variety of visualizations for the county-level data, which can be located in the "Liquor Sales Counties.twb" Tableau workbook. I have also created an R-markdown file entitled "County-LevelRAnalysis.rmd," within which I constructed numerous linear models in order to estimate the causal effect of income on average dollar sales. 

Paul: I have merged the aggregated liquor sales data with ACS data per each geography (zip codes, cities, counties) and uploaded these 3 new data sets using Tableau as 3 individual workbooks to Github, to help with completing additional major project tasks.

Mick: I created a heat map in Tableau that illustrates how the income of different zip codes differ throughout Iowa. I also
wrote an analysis to make conclusions and observations pertaining to the heat map, specifically relating to income "hot spots" and the significance of Iowa's geography when considering income and alcohol consumption.

## Checkpoint 2 Progress

### Checkpoint 2 Individual Group Member Contributions

Mikaela: I created similar visualizations for the city- and zip-code-level data as I created for the county-level data. These visualizations can be located in the "Liquor Sales Cities.twb" and "Liquor Sales Zip-Codes.twb" Tableau worksheets, respectively, within the Team_3Checkpoint_2.0 Branch. I also created a new measure, "sale.dollars.percap," within each of the 3 Tableau worksheets. I then created a scatter diagram, for each level of geographic specificity, plotting per capita dollar sales against income.
