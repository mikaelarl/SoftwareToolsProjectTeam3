# Software Tools Project - Team 3

## ADEC 7900 Software Tools for Data Analysis Group Project
### Team 3
#### Paul Gaski, Michael Pomer, Mikaela Renaud-Lowther, and Justin Nevins

## Research Topic
### The question: 
To what extent does an individual's income affect their consumption of alcohol in Iowa?
### The Decision-Maker and the Decision To-Be-Made
Local policymakers evaluating the efficacy of alcohol excise taxes and determining future levels of these taxes

## The 8 Major Tasks
1. Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration.
2. Analyze and visualize ACS data using Tableau and/or R.
3. Analyze and visualize aggregated sales data using Tableau and/or R.
4. Merge aggregated liquor sales data with ACS data per each geography (zipcodes, cities, counties). This will result in 3 data sets. If using Tableau, create 3 workbooks.
5. Visualize and identify patterns in liquor sales across geographies and ACS metrics using R and/or Tableau.
6. Submit draft of progress at Checkpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2.
7. Summarize your findings in a short video presentation.
8. Publish a detailed, well-formatted R-markdown report of your analytical story to your GitHub repository (see project instructions for details).

## Checkpoint 1 Progress
Our group has completed tasks 1 and 4. We have been working on tasks 2, 3, and 5 (analyzing and visualizing our data in order to identify relevant trends).

### Individual group member contributions: 

Mikaela: I have created a variety of visualizations for the county-level data, which can be located in the "Liquor Sales Counties.twb" Tableau workbook.
